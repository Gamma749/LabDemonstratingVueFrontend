# lab-demonstrating

A web app front end for a [REST api project](https://github.com/Gamma749/LabDemonstratingRESTAPI). 

This project was slapped together in a week, starting with no experience with Vue. If I had the time again I would build this application in a much cleaner way, with better components, management of state, and understanding of Vue. However, as it stands, this project has two important properties:

1. The application works
2. It isn't slow or extravagantly large

And so I am happy to leave this particular project here and move on to other projects with lessons learned.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
